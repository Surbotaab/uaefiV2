## HOWTO JLCPCB

You would need three files from ``boards/uaefi-a/board`` folder to place your JLCPB Assembly order: gerber.zip BOM-JLC.csv and CPL.csv


### Q: having trouble with opening uaefi board project. library path seems ok, i do not know how to solve missing modules issue

A: missing modules are closed source. they are filled in by github magic
github magic combines gerbers and spits out a complete bom/pcl/new gerbers to upload to jlc/friends. See https://github.com/rusefi/hellen-one/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#tldr for more info

### Q: Magic modules? How do I see schematics of those?

A: https://github.com/rusefi/hellen-one has full documentation for each module

### Q: Something wrong with BOM?

A: Nope, that's normal nothing to worry about click 'Continue'.

### Q: how do I get more RAM for Lua?

A: fabricate with STM32F42xVI firmware would defect extra RAM and give you extra Lua. Once your script does not fit into STM32F42xVI it's F7 time or help us leverage F413.

### Q: I've place an order with JLCPCB and I see scary looking wrong orientation?

A: that's expected. See [boards/uaefi-c/board](boards/uaefi-c/board) ``Original*.png`` files and ``Produce*.png`` after JLCPCB manual review process.
